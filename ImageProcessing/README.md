## Resources

*   [Course syllabus](CourseSyllabus.pdf).
*   [Link to book webpage](http://www.ImageProcessingPlace.com), where you you can download all the figures, images, projects, and other good materials.
*   [Lecture Notes](LectureNotes/)
## Assignments

1.  *   Read Ch. 1 in both DIP and DIPUM.
    *   Start using Matlab, read a little in its help, and download some of the images of Ch. 1 from the book webpage and just open them in Matlab.
2.  *   Read Ch. 2 in both DIP and DIPUM, then solve 2.2 and 2.9.
    *   Using Matlab, write functions to: (1) zoom in (2) zoom out (3) decrease the gray level (make sure to use Matlab storage classes appropriately)
3.  *   Write a C program that does bit-shift and link it to Matlab to extract bit-plane.
    *   Solve problem 3.10
4.  Write a Matlab code to reproduce figures 3.30 and 3.31.
5.  *   Verify that the discrete definitions of the first and second derivatives give the required behavior on the flat regions, ramps, onset and end of ramps, and edges.
    *   Choose any image and create 100 noise versions of it. Each version is created by adding uncorrelated normal noise (with zero mean and 10 standard deviation) on each pixel. Reconstruct the original image by averaging 10, 20, 50, and 100 of these versions.
6.  In this H.W. figure numbers follow the 2nd edition of the book.
    *   Reproduce Figure 3.45.
    *   Reproduce Figures 3.46, then produce the same 8 sub-figures for the image in Figure 3.40 (a) and 3.4 (a). Comment on the results.
7.  [Solve this on Fourier](HWFourier.pdf)
8.  [Solve this on Fourier](HWFourier2.pdf)
9.  Find the Fourier Transform (both magnitude and phase) of the delta function, sin, and cos. Also solve problem 4.1
10.  Prove that the Fourier Transform of a Comb function, with period T, is another Comb function (what is its period)? Find the Fourier Transform of a periodic square function with width W and period T. Solve Prob. 4.7
