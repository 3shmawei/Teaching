## Assignments

Assignments follow Gilbert Strang, "Introduction to Linear Algebra", 3rd edition, unless stated.

*   Problem Set 1.1: 1, 2, 16, 18, 19, 23.
*   Problem Set 1.2: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 12, 13, 29.
*   Problem Set 2.1: 27, 33.
*   Problem Set 2.2: 1, 7, 11.
*   This homework is to refresh your background on summations and indicies:
    *   solve problems of Ch. 1 in Searle ([download](Assignments/SearleQuestions.pdf)) and [these](Assignments/HWLinearAlgebra01.pdf) problems.
    *   Write a program (C, Matlab, or any other) to calculate the time of the two versions vs. matrix size n.
*   Problem Set 2.5: 1, 7, 8, 10, 15, 25, 29, 36.
*   Problem Set 2.6: 1, 2, 5, 10, 11, 13, 15, 18.
*   Computer programs and problems on complexity:
    *   Write a function to do Gauss-Jordan elemination (keep track of zeros and pivots to reduce complexity)
    *   Insert a counter in all loops of the previous function and plot the number of multiplications and summations.
    *   Compare the complexity to that one of a goofy function that does not take into account zeros produced by elimination.
